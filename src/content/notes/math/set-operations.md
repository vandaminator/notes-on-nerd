## Set Operations

### 1. Union ( ∪ )

- **Definition**: The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements that are in \(A\), in \(B\), or in both.
- **Notation**: \( A ∪ B \)
- **Example**: If \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), then \( A ∪ B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \).

### 2. Intersection ( ∩ )

- **Definition**: The intersection of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements that are in both \(A\) and \(B\).
- **Notation**: \( A ∩ B \)
- **Example**: If \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), then \( A ∩ B = \{3\} \).

### 3. Difference ( - )

- **Definition**: The difference of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) (also known as the complement of \(B\) in \(A\)) is the set of elements that are in \(A\) but not in \(B\).
- **Notation**: \( A - B \) or \( A \setminus B \)
- **Example**: If \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), then \( A - B = \{1, 2\} \).

### 4. Symmetric Difference ( Δ )

- **Definition**: The symmetric difference of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements that are in either \(A\) or \(B\) but not in their intersection.
- **Notation**: \( A Δ B \) or \( A \oplus B \)
- **Example**: If \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), then \( A Δ B = \{1, 2, 4, 5\} \).

### 5. Complement ( \(A^c\) or \( \overline{A} \) )

- **Definition**: The complement of a set \(A\) with respect to a universal set \(U\) is the set of elements that are in \(U\) but not in \(A\).
- **Notation**: \( A^c \) or \( \overline{A} \)
- **Example**: If \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) and \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), then \( A^c = \{4, 5\} \).

### Venn Diagrams

- **Definition**: A Venn diagram is a visual representation of mathematical sets. Venn diagrams show all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets.
- **Example**: For sets \( A \) and \( B \):
  - The union \( A ∪ B \) is represented by shading the area covering both circles.
  - The intersection \( A ∩ B \) is represented by shading the overlapping area of the two circles.
  - The difference \( A - B \) is represented by shading the part of \( A \) that does not overlap with \( B \).
  - The symmetric difference \( A Δ B \) is represented by shading the areas of \( A \) and \( B \) that do not overlap.
