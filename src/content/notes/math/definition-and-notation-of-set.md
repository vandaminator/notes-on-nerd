## Definition

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Sets are one of the fundamental concepts in mathematics.

## Notation

- **Curly Braces `{}`**: Used to denote a set. For example, the set of natural numbers less than 5 can be written as `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- **Capital Letters**: Sets are usually denoted by capital letters. For example, `A = {1, 2, 3}`.
- **Element Notation `∈`**: The symbol `∈` denotes membership. For example, if `A = {1, 2, 3}`, then `1 ∈ A`.
- **Not an Element Notation `∉`**: The symbol `∉` denotes non-membership. For example, `4 ∉ A` if `A = {1, 2, 3}`.
- **Empty Set `∅` or `{}`**: A set with no elements. For example, the set of natural numbers less than 1 is `∅`.
- **Subset `⊆`**: The symbol `⊆` denotes a subset. For example, if `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {1, 2}`, then `B ⊆ A`.
- **Proper Subset `⊂`**: The symbol `⊂` denotes a proper subset, meaning all elements of `B` are in `A`, and `A` has more elements than `B`. For example, `{1, 2} ⊂ {1, 2, 3}`.
- **Universal Set `U`**: The set that contains all the objects under consideration, often denoted by `U`.
- **Set-builder Notation**: Describes the elements of a set by a property they satisfy. For example, `{ x | x > 0 }` denotes the set of all positive numbers.

## Examples

1. **Finite Set**: A set with a limited number of elements.
   - Example: `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
2. **Infinite Set**: A set with an unlimited number of elements.
   - Example: `B = {x | x ∈ \mathbb{N}}`, where \mathbb{N} denotes the set of natural numbers.
3. **Singleton Set**: A set with exactly one element.
   - Example: `C = {7}`
4. **Empty Set**: A set with no elements.
   - Example: `D = ∅` or `D = {}`
